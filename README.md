SQL for Data Analysis
Objective
This project demonstrates the use of SQL queries to extract, manipulate, and analyze data from an Ecommerce_SQL_Database using PostgreSQL.

Tools Used
PostgreSQL

Dataset
A simulated e-commerce dataset containing:

products: List of products with category, price, stock quantity, and date added.

sales: Records of product sales including quantity and sale date.

Key Concepts Applied
Data Retrieval and Filtering: SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY

Aggregation: GROUP BY, SUM, AVG, COUNT

Table Joins: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN

Subqueries: Used for conditional filtering based on aggregate values

Views: Created reusable views for sales summary

Indexes: Added to optimize query performance

SQL Features Demonstrated
Create and insert data into tables

Execute analysis queries such as:

Total products by category

Products with above-average price

Total revenue from sales

Product-wise sales performance

Use of joins to combine data across tables

Creation of indexed columns for performance

Defined views for ongoing analysis

Deliverables
ecommerce_analysis.sql: Contains all table definitions, data inserts, and queries.

Screenshots folder: Includes output screenshots of each major query.

Outcome
Hands-on experience in querying and analyzing structured data using PostgreSQL. This project builds foundational skills in SQL for real-world data analysis tasks.
