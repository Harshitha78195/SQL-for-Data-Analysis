# SQL for Data Analysis â€“ Ecommerce Dataset

## Objective
This project demonstrates how to use **PostgreSQL** for performing data analysis on a structured **Ecommerce SQL Database**. It includes creation of tables, data insertion, and a variety of SQL queries to extract insights from the data.

---

## Tools Used
- PostgreSQL
- SQL (DDL & DML)
- pgAdmin or any PostgreSQL client

---

## Dataset Overview
Two tables were created:
- `products`: Stores details about ecommerce products.
- `sales`: Stores sales transaction records linked to products.

---

## SQL Concepts Covered
- Basic Queries: `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`
- Joins: `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`
- Subqueries
- Aggregate Functions: `SUM`, `AVG`
- Views for summarized analysis
- Index creation for query optimization

---

## Deliverables
- `ecommerce_analysis.sql`: SQL file containing:
  - Table creation
  - Data insertion (20+ rows)
  - Analysis queries
- `/screenshots`: Folder containing screenshots of query results

---

## Learning Outcome
- Gained hands-on experience in querying structured data
- Learned to analyze sales trends, revenue, and product insights
- Practiced query optimization with indexing

---

##  How to Use
1. Import `ecommerce_analysis.sql` into your PostgreSQL environment.
2. Run queries sequentially or as needed.
3. Refer to `/screenshots` for expected outputs.
